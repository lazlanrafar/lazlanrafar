Hi i'm L Azlan Rafar, a web Developer based in Indonesia. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform.

Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects.
