### Hi there ï¿½![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52142835/152094748-215951a1-aab1-4659-a4b8-7a146b4d0648.png)

Hii I'm L Azlan Rafar, a web developer from Indonesia. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform.

Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing technical things at my blog.
